Forward port 5000 on router to raspberry

Raspberry GPIO description
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/
	Ports are 3.3V
Arduino GPIO description
	https://oscarliang.com/raspberry-pi-and-arduino-connected-serial-gpio/
	Tx is 5V
	Rx is compatible with 3.3v input
	BUT ARDUINO MUST NOT BE CONNECTED TO RASPBERRY WHEN FLASHED
		Raspberry may be damaged, I lost an SD card to that

Launch manually to test
	python3 wakeUp.py
	
Put in auto start from boot
	sudo crontab -e
	add on the last line:
		@reboot sudo python3 /home/pi/wakeUp.py &
	Ctrl-X to save & quit
	
Test webinterface
	http://yourIP:5000/lights?Command=WakeUp
	
IFTTT
	Create account
	Manual test
		https://ifttt.com/create/if-button-press-then-make-a-web-request?sid=20
		If button is pressed on widget, then send the following command
			yourIP:5000/lights?Command=WakeUp
			GET
			text/plain
			WakeUp
		Put the widget on your phone, try it, check that you get something on the server
		
Sleep as Android
	Enable IFTTT connection
		http://sleep.urbandroid.org/documentation/integration/ifttt/
	I had some bug
		Do as advised, login on IFTTT from the Sleep app
		Wait until something is written on top, or try to refresh by going in the IFTTT settings of Maker, and tap edit the connection to Maker
		Once it appears, delete everything that does not look like the key, like <dd> </dd>
		A that point it worked, the key was valid
	On IFTTT website, do a new IFTTT recipe
		if Maker -> Receive a web request -> Event Name == alarm_alert_start
		then Maker -> send the command yourIP:5000/lights?Command=WakeUp
On arduino
	Televerse the wakeUp.ino
	
Connections
	Raspberry GND to Arduino GND
	Raspberry 3 to Arduino A4
	Raspberry 5 to Arduino A5
